# Diabetes-Prediction

Diabetes is a condition where the body fails to utilize the ingested glucose properly. This could be due to lack of the hormone insulin or because the insulin that is available is not working effectively. 
Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.
Current practice in hospital is to collect required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests and appropriate treatment is provided based on diagnosis. 

Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each diabetes patients, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Data Set Characteristics :-

Number of Attributes:  First 10 columns are numeric predictive values
Target:                Column 11 is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline
Attribute Information: Age - Sex - Body mass index - Average blood pressure - S1 - S2 - S3 - S4 - S5 - S6

Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times n-samples (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).
